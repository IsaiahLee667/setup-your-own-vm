# Create a VM lab
What OS is your VM running?
24.04.02 Noble Numbat

What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?
Link to 24.04.02 Noble Numbat in the lab gave an error as if it did not exist, I had to find a site with older versions of Linux and download the ISO from there. It worked fine though the download was very slow.

How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? Why did you choose these amounts?
4 GB RAM/32 GB Hard Drive space, based on recommended from lab.

What do you think would happen if you allocated too much RAM to your VM?
Potentially the main/actual computer suffers from RAM being locked off by the VM machine when on. Unsure as 4 GB is not enough to notice on my personal specs (64 GB RAM), but that would be my guess. 
## Your first VM (Ubuntu VM)
What settings did you change and why?
those noted (Hardware Acceleration and Bidirectional Clipboard) and Wifi settings from Virtual box, which i had to change from NAT to Bridged Adapter in order to get it downloading/using the Network for the sake of updates.

How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings?
It performed about the same? Admittedly, I did not do that much beyond the instructions, so I have very little to use as a comparison. 

What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VM’s performance?
Power consumption settings, Multicore support (though probably not), Monitor Settings

## Your second VM (Windows VM)
What OS is your VM running?
Windows 10

What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?
Not as many as the prior/Ubuntu VM. The baseline Windows 10 installer seemed to go by simpler/with less button presses but also any hiccups encountered this time, I had met already with the Ubuntu VM and dealt with quickly.
How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? Why did you choose these amounts?
4GB RAM, 32 GB SSD based on the recommended specs.
What do you think would happen if you allocated too much RAM to your VM?
Potentially the main/actual computer suffers from RAM being locked off by the VM machine when on. Unsure as 4 GB is not enough to notice on my personal specs (64 GB RAM), but that would be my guess. I do not think the VM would suffer from 1000GB of assigned RAM as long as it was compatible, though perhaps that in and off itself is the answer, that it is only compatible with a certain amount of ram. 

What settings did you change and why?
Bidirectional Keyboard, Hardware Acceleration, Video memory at or greater than 128MB from Details. 

How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings?
Less stuttering when opening programs/accessing settings

What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VM’s performance?
Power consumption settings, Multicore support (though probably not), Monitor Settings
